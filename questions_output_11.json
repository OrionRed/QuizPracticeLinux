A CI represents an item under configuration management, such as a router, a server, an application, a virtual machine, a container, or even a logical construct such as a portfolio. Data import tools are usually used to identify CIs in the environment, and transfer them to the CMDB. Some IT teams may also use manual tools to keep their CMDB updated but this is not a good practice as it cannot scale and it introduces errors - duplicates and un-necessary CIs. Once all of the information is gathered and unified, it must be reviewed for accuracy and consistency, and any data-gaps should be identified and resolved."

    "wpProQuiz_correct": "Update Sets are used to move customizations and configurations from one ServiceNow instance to another. Workflows, being a type of customization, can be moved between instances using Update Sets. When you create an Update Set, you can add workflows to it, along with any related components such as tables, fields, business rules, and UI pages. Once you have created an Update Set, you can then export it from the source instance and import it into the target instance. This allows you to move workflows and other customizations between instances as needed.The system tracks workflows in update sets differently than other records because workflow information is stored across multiple tables.Changes made to a workflow version are not added to the update set until the workflow is published, at which point the entire workflow is added into the update set. Update sets store workflows as a single Workflow [wf_workflow] record and only retain the latest version with the update type of Workflow."

The system dictionary provides options for administrators to modify tables and fields, which in turn define lists and forms.Use caution when changing system dictionary records because changes can have a high impact on functionality. In particular, changes to dictionary entries for system tables, which are tables that begin with sys_, can create system-wide issues such as the inability to use update sets.Dictionary changes are difficult to reverse. Also, dictionary changes automatically apply to all extended tables unless a dictionary override is defined. Be sure that changes are well-tested before applying them to a production instance."
