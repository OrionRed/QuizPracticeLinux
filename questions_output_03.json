Dynamic page variables load keywords that are based on data in a record. The page parameters in the URL specify which record to use.Some portal pages load data from a record that\u0026#8216;s specified by a parameter in the URL. For these pages, you can use dynamic page variables to add meta tags, page titles, and human-readable URL keywords that vary depending on the record loaded on the page.In the following examples, the category and short description of a knowledge article and the category and name of a catalogue item are added as keywords:https:///kb/en/faq/what-is-a-cookie?id=kb_article_view\u0026#038;sysparm_article=KB0000007https:///sp/es/hardware/developer-laptop-mac?id=sc_cat_item\u0026#038;sys_id=774906834fbb4200086eeed18110c737In the \u0026#8216;Human readable url structure\u0026#8216; field of the page record, you can specify the keywords to populate the page URL using\u00A0static content, dynamic page variables, or a combination.Keywords can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens (\u2010), one slash (/), and per cent signs (%) for variables."
