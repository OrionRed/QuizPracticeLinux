The look and feel of a record producer is similar to that of a catalog item. But the record producer generates a task record such as incident, instead of a requested item.You can create a record producer for tables and database views that are in the same scope as the record producer. You can also create a record producer for tables that allow create access from applications in other scopes.Define a record producer in the service catalog or from the table record."
