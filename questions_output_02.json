It also helps you maintain a unified content categorisation across content types such as catalogue items, knowledge articles, and community posts.\nContent Taxonomy\u00A0is the application that provides the data model or the topic hierarchy and the taxonomy management (content authoring) capabilities for the unified taxonomy. The content types mapped by default are requests, articles, quick links, and employee communications. Once the plugin is downloaded, this mapping will be visible as part of the content taxonomy app in the platform."
